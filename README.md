# Creating a machine learning model in 2 hours to project the best fantasy baseball players
My attempt to make my first machine learning algorithm. This model projects the MLB baseball players that will produce the most fantasy points in under 2 hours (before my draft). This is by no means a finished or polished product, just something to showcase what I can do in a time crunch. This is my first attempt at using machine learning. I plan on improving upon this project in the future since I did make some mistakes that I could not feasibly solve in 2 hours in a different repository.
